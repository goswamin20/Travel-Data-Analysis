WE will be executing the examples using various API's present in Apache Spark such as RDD's.\n\n\n###Dataset\n1. <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kavyaprasad/data/master/TravelData.csv\"><b>TravelData.csv</b></a> - This file contails data about Travel. The various attributes present in the dataset are\n  1. City Pair: The origin-destination pair of travel (STRING)\n  2. From Location: The origin of travel (STRING)\n  3. To Location: The destination of travel (STRING)\n  4. Product Type: This attribute tells us about the mode of travel and the various combinations which the traveller opted. Here 1 represents Air, 2 represents car,    represents Air+Car, 4 represents Hotel, 5 represents Air+Hotel, 6 represents Hotel+Car, 7 represents Air+Hotel+Car) (INTEGER)\n  5. Adults Traveling: Number of adults travelling (INTEGER)\n  6. Seniors Traveling: Number of seniors travelling (INTEGER)\n  7. Children Traveling:  Number of children travelling (INTEGER)\n  8. Youth Traveling:  Number of youth travelling (INTEGER)\n  9. Infant Traveling:  Number of infants travelling (INTEGER)\n  10. Date of Travel: The date of travel(STRING)\n  11. Time of Travel: The time of travel(STRING)\n  12. Date of Return: The date of return (STRING)\n  13. Time of Return: The time of return (STRING)\n  14. Price of booking: The price of booking hotel (FLOAT)\n  15. Airline code: The code with which each airlines is denoted (STRING)\n  16. Airline: The airline name (STRING)\n  17. Hotel:The hotel name (STRING)\n  \n ###PROBLEM STATEMENT\nThe travel and tourism industry is one of the largest industries which contributes to trillions of dollars to the global economy. The analysis of travel data will be done in order to gain insights to data and help the travel and hospitality industry to offer various beneÔ¨Åts to the customers, increase marketing, strategic decisions etc. It will help the industry to better understand their target audience.In this project,we are analysing the travel data which includes data such as destination city, source city, mode of commute, the hotel they will be staying at, type of audience such as youth, children, adults etc. This project will prove helpful for both the hospitality industry and customers."],"metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Dataset Link\n\nDownload the dataset using the shell command wget and the URL, save them into the tmp directory.
